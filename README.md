## How to share LPyWeb with other users ?

If you want to access the application with other machines without re-installing all the project, you can run it with the command : flask run --host=IP_HOST_MACHINE.
(IP_HOST_MACHINE is the IP adress of the machine which run the flask application)
You can check the IP adress using : "ip a show" or "ifconfig" (or ipconfig on Windows)
Then you just have to enter http://IP_HOST_MACHINE:5000 in your navigator to have access to LPyWeb. However, the host machine and the client ones must be connected on the same network.

An other way is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to share your localhost with other users.
